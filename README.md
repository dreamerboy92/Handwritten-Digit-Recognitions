# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Overview
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

---

## Features
- Preprocessing of handwritten digit images
- Model training using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance
- Prediction on new handwritten digit images
- Visualization of sample predictions and training results

---

## Dataset
- **MNIST Dataset:** The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).
- Training set: 60,000 images
- Test set: 10,000 images

The MNIST dataset is publicly available and can be loaded directly using popular ML libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- scikit-learn (optional for additional metrics)
